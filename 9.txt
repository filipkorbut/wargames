# I found the password using "string"
# While scrolling through the "man" of string I came across the "-d"
# parameter which I don't quite understand. I saw that it "reduces
# the amount of garbage in the output" to I tried it and somehow
# it worked

# I googled other solutions and came across this

strings data.txt | grep -E "=+{^=}"

# I didn't know that "strings can be used to extract readable strings"
# Well, I wouldn't use this regex anyway since I'm not a big fan of
# regexes in general

# Command used
strings -d (and then manually scanning through the output)

# Password to bandit 10
