# To find the password I first entered the root directory, then I
# tweaked around with parameters of find specifically
# "-user <input>" - looks for a file with a specified owner
# "-group <input" - the same thing but for a group
# "-size <input>" - looks for a file of a specified size

# My approach was to check all of these flags at once but once I got
# flooded with a wall of text I quickly abandoned this idea. I have to
# find a way to exclude the files I don't have permission to in the
# result

# From now on even if I don't use all the flags/commands that are
# specified in the instructions I'll try to list them here anyway

# Command used
find -user bandit7 -size 33c
cat /var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password

# Password to bandit7
