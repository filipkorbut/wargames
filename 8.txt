# This one was difficult. I didn't notice I could use "uniq" so I 
# Went over to stackoverflow and found an answer there 
# (I will try to avoid this in the future)

# I just want to point out that I'm doing these without the help of
# Chatgpt and I'm trying to find the solution with the help of 
# documentations and "man"

# I used a pipe with "uniq" and "sort"
# Note to myself: uniq -u only works if the identical lines are adjacent 

# Command used 
sort data.txt | uniq -u
